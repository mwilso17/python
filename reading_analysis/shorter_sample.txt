This is a short history of the beginnings of the music genre known as Heavy Metal.
The first ever true Heavy Metal sound came from the song Black Sabbath, which was written
by the English band also named Black Sabbath. This distinct sound, which had never
been heard by human ears before, came about partially due to an accident. The guitarist of 
Black Sabbath, Tony Iommi, was working an industrial job and lost the tips of two of his
fingers in an incident involving a Guillotine Press. This injury caused by heavy machinery made Tony alter the way
he played his guitar which, perhaps ironically, gave us the first distinct sounds in the music genre of Heavy Metal.
